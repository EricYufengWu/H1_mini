#Hexapod H2_mini

This is an open-source hexapod robot that can be controlled via your smartphone, tablet, and computer wirelessly. Also, this is possibly the smallest, fully open-source, and low-cost hexapod robot as of September, 2019 - it's only 3 inches whide while retracted, and it weighs less than 4 oz!

Assembly tutorials, CAD models, and videos of the robot working will be posted soon.
